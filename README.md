Advent of Code
==============

My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

I generally use NeoVim, Zellij and other CLI tools to get things done.
The bash script named advent-of-code lets me quickly create and jump into zellij sessions
with a customized, opinionated layout and setup according to the language used that year.

These are the years, where I have solved puzzles and the language used:

* 23 -> Zig (tested stuff out in preparation for 24, not complete yet)
* 24 -> Zig
